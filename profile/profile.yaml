# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I am a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Engineering specializing in Computer Engineering from Ryerson University. During my undergraduate career, I gained a solid understanding of algorithms and data structures. The courses and projects that I completed especially piqued my interest in data engineering and machine learning. It has also helped me to become adept at adapting to different technologies and programming languages, a strong problem-solver, and a big advocate for taking on new challenges. Currently as a Data Engineer at Jarvis, I have had the opportunity to develop various software projects to further my knowledge of database systems, the latest tools and technologies such as Java, Docker, REST APIs, and Git. I am passionate about working on projects that require me to explore areas outside of my comfort, as continuing to learn new languages and technologies are important to me.

# List of Jarvis projects
jarvis_projects:
  - name: "Cluster Monitor"
    git_url: "/linux_sql"
    # The project description allows hiring managers to understand your project and technologies you used(e.g. programming languages, libraries, algorithms, hardware, tools, etc.).
    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/3guO98u)
    description: Developed a Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent that manages a cluster of Linux nodes/hosts that run on CentOS7. The connection between the hosts are enabled through a network switch and communication is accomplished via internal IPv4 addresses. Using Docker containers, a PostgreSQL database instance was provisioned to persist hardware and resource usage data in real-time through bash scripts. A few SQL queries were created to analyze the data and answer business questions related to better managing the cluster planning for future recourses.
  - name: "Core Java Apps"
    git_url: "/core_java"
    description:
      - "Twitter App: Designed a Twitter command-line application that allows users to post, show, or delete a tweet using the Twitter REST API. Utilizes OAuthConsumer, HttpClient, and Jackson libraries for user authentication/object serialization. Implemented the Spring framework to manage dependencies, JUnit/Mockito for testing, and Docker to deploy the app."
      - "JDBC App: Implemented an application that leverages JDBC to connect to a dockerized PostgreSQL database, allowing users to perform CRUD operations on the data. The functionality of the app is based on the DAO pattern."
      - "Grep App: Developed a Java application that simulates the functionality of the Linux/Unix grep command-line tool which allows users to search for matching strings within a file, given three arguments. Utilizes Lambda & Stream APIs to optimize performance and memory usage. The app was packaged by Maven and the dockerized image of the project was deployed to DockerHub."
